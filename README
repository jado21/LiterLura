CONSULTING BOOK SHELTER

Description:
This projecty was made with the porpuse to apply the knowledge adquire through attented lessons. Mainly, We focus in devolping through JAVA language.
This code uses a free API, called Gutendex, API that allows us to consult a great variety of open source books. Also, we implemented a MENU to help the user
to interact with the software. We are using PostgreSQL to save the data that were consulted previously, thanks to Gutendex

Functions:
To resume, the program essentially has 6 functions that can be seen in the menu:
1. To consult any book by title : In this function we create a connection to the Gutendex API to recieve the proper information about the book solicitated. We also made use of concepts like HttpClient and JSON to manipulate the data
2. To list all books: We make use JpaRepository , a tool provided by Maven repository that helps us to save , get and delete data from our database efficiently and quickly
3. To list all authors
4. To get book authors in a determinated year
